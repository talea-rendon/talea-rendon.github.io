  <h1>Electric Waves</h1>
<p>Electric waves is an audio/visual experience created as a result of my love and research of the deep sea, specifically the phenomena known as bioluminescence. My gallery room is decorated with sea lilies and venus flower baskets which are some of my favorite deep sea organisms. These, along with many other sea creatures are facing a rapid decrease in their population as a result of deepwater fishing, climate change, marine litter, and various pollutants. The video aspect of my piece focuses on the use of red and blue bioluminescence which only certain organisms are able to see. The majority of deep sea fish are only able to see certain colored light, typically blue, and are blind to everything else. There are rare instances where some species (usually predators) are able to see red light that is visible to only them. The main video follows a loose narrative about a blue fish being lured in by an “invisible” red fish. There is a second video showing fireworks that change color as the narrative progresses. These fireworks mirror what bioluminescence looks like in most scientific documentation. When creatures bump into the camera and light up, they create these tiny fireworks. This piece is meant to show the beauty and wonder of a world many of us are not exposed to. We are not so different from the creatures of the deep sea, both blind to much of the world and ignorant of the true impact we have.
