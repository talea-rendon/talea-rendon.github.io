<div class="about">
  <p>I use a wide variety of mediums in order to explore the infinite possibilities of Digital Media. I use my work to look into and comment on the digital based world we live in today. My pieces tend to reflect the media saturated world we inhabit, the constant flow of information and advertisements being fed to us at all times, and how this new age of technology forms a relationship with the natural world. </p>

<p>I am very familiar with the Adobe Creative Suite, most of my projects have been done using Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and/or After Effects. My 3D work has been done in Blender and Fusion 360. I have experience with projection mapping using software such as MadMapper, TouchDesigner, and Resolum along with stage set up/tear down and rigging projectors/lighting. I also know how to write html, css, java, javascript, and arduino.</p>
