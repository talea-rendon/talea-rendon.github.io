For my second Project, I am using p5js to create an interactive commentary on the state of our oceans, specifically overfishing. One-third of the world's assessed fisheries are currently pushed beyond their biological limits, meaning people are catching fish quicker than they can replenish. This not only affects the ocean’s ecosystem and environment but also has a direct impact on humans. Fishing is the primary livelihood of millions of people around the world and billions of people rely on fish as a dietary staple. It is predicted that if the trends we are currently seeing in the fishing industry continue, the world’s oceans could be virtually emptied of fish by 2048. This is a major problem we are facing and that many people are unaware of. 
I am using p5js to create a sketch in which the viewer can move their mouse across the screen from 2012 to 2042 and see as particles appear/disappear representing the depletion of fish in our oceans. This way the viewers can see just how fast this change is happening and how large of a difference it is. Not only will the circles/particles appear and disappear but the color of the screen will also change as a way to show the increase of pollution in our oceans.
